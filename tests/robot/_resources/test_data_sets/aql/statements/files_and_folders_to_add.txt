Add in statements folder, all AQL statements to be checked as part of AQL_TESTS test package.
All files will be grouped in separate folders, depending on feature AQL statement is covering.
Files will be saved in .json format, with suggestive naming.
AQL statement will have static and dynamic part, like in below example:
SELECT FIELDS_TO_PROVIDE FROM EHR e CONTAINS COMPOSITION c [archetype_node_id_value]
--> Where FIELDS_TO_PROVIDE is dynamic part, where 1..* fields can be provided, separated by comma.
--> Where archetype_node_id_value is dynamic part.
--> All other keywords are static.
